        <div class="subheading mb-5">Administrative EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently enrolled as a student at the University of California, Riverside, working toward a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Administrative Economics with a concentration in Finance. My goal is to eventually sit for the CPA exam and become a chartered accountant, which would allow me to establish myself in the field of financial accounting. Ultimately, I aspire to work at one of the Big 4 accounting firms, gaining invaluable experience and contributing to the world of finance at the highest level.To build a strong foundation for my career, I have already completed the accounting course offered at UCR and am now seeking further hands-on experience. While I have engaged in volunteer work, I recognize the importance of real-world exposure in accounting and finance. Therefore, I am actively working toward securing an internship or a shadowing opportunity with a professional accountant. Gaining insight into the inner workings of financial reporting, auditing, and taxation will be crucial for my professional development and will bring me one step closer to my ultimate goal.
 <br><br>

        Looking ahead, I am planning to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Finance or Economics in London. Institutions such as the London School of Economics (LSE) and Cambridge University are particularly appealing due to their strong global reputation and connections to top financial firms. By earning my masterâ€™s degree in one of these prestigious institutions, I hope to broaden my career prospects and gain the qualifications necessary to secure a high-level role in financial accounting. The European and UK financial sectors offer a unique perspective that, combined with my U.S. education, would make me a strong candidate for major firms. Currently, I am based in the Bay Area, but I am actively looking for internship opportunities either in the Riverside area or in New York City, where the financial sector is especially prominent. New York, in particular, is appealing as I have family members who work in major banks such as JP Morgan Chase and other financial institutions. They have shown me the importance of this field and how their careers have remained stable and rewarding, even with the rise of artificial intelligence and automation. Many industries are being transformed by AI, but financial accounting, taxation, and corporate finance remain areas that require human expertise, strategic thinking, and ethical judgmentâ€”qualities that no AI system can fully replicate. <br><br>

        One of the primary reasons I am drawn to this field is the essential role accounting plays in every business. Companies, regardless of their size, must rely on accurate financial reporting, tax compliance, and regulatory adherence to maintain their operations. Financial accountants serve as the backbone of these organizations, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. This reliability makes accounting one of the most stable and respected professions in the financial world. Additionally, I am motivated by the fact that the corporate finance world is still male-dominated. While women have made significant strides in business, finance, and leadership roles, there is still progress to be made. I want to be part of the movement pushing for greater gender diversity in finance and accounting, proving that women can thrive in this sector just as much as men. Representation is incredibly important, and I believe that by excelling in this field, I can inspire other young women to pursue careers in finance without hesitation. As I continue on this journey, I am eager to gain more experience, network with professionals in the industry, and refine my skills. My long-term vision is to work in corporate finance or financial auditing, potentially at a Big 4 firm or a major financial institution. With my strong academic background, passion for accounting, and drive to break barriers, I am confident that I can make a meaningful impact in this field.
